In this repository, I will perform tasks to solve some real world problems (questions) related to data science like cleaning data, analyzing data and visualizing it.
You will also get `README.md` file in all the Data sets containing some information about that data.

## A] Sales_Analysis

To do Sales Analysis firstly we will have to clean our data and also perform some tasks.

### Tasks:

1. Converting many CSV files into one CSV file.

2. Drop NaN values from DataFrame

3. Convert 'Quantity Ordered' and 'Price Each' columns into numeric value using 'to_numeric' method

4. Adding columns (Month, City, Sales)

5. Removing rows based on a conditions (rows contains NaN values)

6. Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

### Questions:

Q.1 What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?

Q.2 What city sold the most product?

Q.3 What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?

Q.4 What products are most often sold together?

Q.5 What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

#### NOTE: Please wait I will upload more DataSets and will solve more real world problems on that Datasets.
