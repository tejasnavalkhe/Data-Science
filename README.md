In this repository, I will perform tasks to solve some real world problems (questions) related to DataScience like Cleaning Data, Analyzing Data and Visualizing it.
You will also get `README.md` file in all the Data sets containing some information about that data.

## [A\] Sales_Analysis](https://github.com/tejasnavalkhe1810/Data-Science/tree/master/Sales_Analysis)

To do Sales Analysis firstly we will have to clean our data and also perform some tasks.

### Tasks:

1. Converting many CSV files into one CSV file.

2. Drop NaN values from DataFrame

3. Convert 'Quantity Ordered' and 'Price Each' columns into numeric value using 'to_numeric' method

4. Adding columns (Month, City, Sales)

5. Removing rows based on a conditions (rows contains NaN values)

6. Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

### Questions:

Q.1 What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?

Q.2 What city sold the most product?

Q.3 What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?

Q.4 What products are most often sold together?

## [B\] Apple_Stock](https://github.com/tejasnavalkhe1810/Data-Science/tree/master/Apple_Stock)

The Apple_Stock data has been already cleaned in `appl_1980_2014.csv` file in '`Apple_Stock`' folder.

### Tasks:

1. Convert 'Date' columns into Datetime data type using 'pd.to_datetime(apple['Date'])' method

2. Adding columns (month, day)

### Questions:

Q.1 Get the last business day of each month

Q.2 What is the difference in days between the first day and the oldest?

Q.3 How many months in the data we have??

Q.4 Plot the 'Adj Close' value. Set the size of the figure to 13.5 x 9 inches.

#### NOTE: I will upload more DataSets and will solve more real world problems on that Datasets.
